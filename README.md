# sudoku

A Python project to solve Sudoku puzzles.

Back in about 2007 at Tableau, we were casting around for a short coding assignment to use for technical screening. At the time I had just discovered Sudoku, so I suggested the assignment could be to write a Sudoku solver in their language of choice. To make sure that this was a reasonable sized task, I sat down and wrote my own. It wasn't very smart - it only knows the standard rules and can't make inferences - but it worked and it didn't take very long, which was the goal.

The other day my son sent me a YouTube video called [The Miracle Sudoku](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKf9aUIxdb4) where they added three more constraints (kings and knights moves, plus a non-sequential adjacency requirement) so I decided to dust off the script and extend it to handle such rules.
